Firewall Traffic Classification Project

This project focuses on creating a classification model that predicts the class of incoming traffic to a firewall using machine learning algorithms. The main objective is to accurately classify network traffic into predefined categories to enhance security and traffic management. The project involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation using a labeled dataset. The project is implemented in Python using Google Colab, with visualizations and model comparisons.
